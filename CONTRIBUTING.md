## Drips Wave — Earn Rewards

StellarZK participates in the **Stellar Drips Wave** program. Funded issues are tagged with the `Stellar Wave` label on GitHub and detailed in the project's issue list.

**How it works:**
1. Browse funded issues at [drips.network/wave](https://www.drips.network/wave).
2. Apply to an issue on the Drips platform (log in with your GitHub account).
3. A maintainer will review your application and assign you within 24–48 hours.
4. Implement the feature, submit your Pull Request, and get it merged.
5. Earn your point rewards once the Wave cycle closes!

**Point values:**
- 🟢 **Trivial** — 100 points (docs fixes, translations, simple bugs)
- 🟡 **Medium** — 150 points (standard REST APIs, CI pipelines, UI layouts)
- 🔴 **High** — 200 points (core contract features, complete integrations, SDK architecture)

## Branching & Workflow

We follow a standard **feature branch** workflow:
* `main` — always stable, production-ready.
* `feat/your-feature-name` — feature branch for specific issues.
* `fix/bug-fix-name` — bug fix branch.

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a branch from `main` named after your issue: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Commit with clear, present-tense messages: `git commit -m "add support for X"`
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

Every Pull Request must:
* Reference the issue it resolves: `Closes #XX`
* Include comprehensive tests covering happy path, error paths, and boundary conditions.
* Pass all CI checks.
* For smart contracts: compile cleanly and pass SoroGuard static analysis scans.
* Update documentation to match any interface or behavior changes.
